brief: "Uses CNN/LSTM deep learning model to classify RF faults using waveform data extending slightly past the fault."
# This is YAML's block scaler with block-chomping set to keep final newlines, and an indent indicator (|+2) or

    This model uses CNN/LSTM deep learning models to identify the faulted cavity and fault type of a C100 event based 
    on the waveform data captured by harvester daemon.

    This model is based on work done by Chris Tennant, Lasitha Vidyaratne, Md. Monibor Rahman, Tom Powers, etc. and
    represents an improved model used to identify which cavity and fault type is associated with a C100 fault event.
    Any individual cavity can be identified as the offending cavity.  Any collection of multiple cavities faulting at
    the same time are given the generic label of 'multiple'.  The following fault types may be identified by the model:
    Controls Fault, E_Quench, Heat Riser Choke, Microphonics, Quench_100ms, Quench_3ms, Single Cav Turn off, and
    Multi-cav Turn off.  The fault model is no longer trained on Multi Cav turn off, as we use only the cavity model
    to identify that condition.

    Signals analyzed are the GMES, GASK, DETA2, and CRFP waveforms for all eight cavities.  The signals are cropped just
    after the fault, down sampled to 4096 samples, and standardized using a modified z-score with 0.001 fill for
    constant signals.
  
    The cavity model was first trained on data from Nov 2019 to Feb 2022, then we used transfer learning to train only
    on the data from May 2022 - July 2022.  The fault type model was trained on data from Nov 2019 - July 2022 without
    the use of transfer learning.
  
    Zone 0L04 continues to be excluded from analysis based on the recommendation of Tom Powers.

    Additional documentation is available in the package docs folder.
